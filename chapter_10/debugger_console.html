	<p>To use the debugger in chrome without writing "debugger" you must have a separate JavaScript file.  Open in the sources tab.</p>
	<p>To use the example click on line number 6, that will set a breakpoint.  Then refresh the browser and it will stop at line six.  It will display the age value.</p>
	<p>You can also add "age" to the watch area, you can step over and step into the function calls.</p>
